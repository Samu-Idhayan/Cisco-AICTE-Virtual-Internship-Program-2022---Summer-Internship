# Cisco-AICTE-Virtual-Internship-Program-2022---Summer-Internship
---
I had the pleasure of interning at Cisco Networking Academy this summer in their 'AICTE Virtual Internship Program 2022'. I loved learning how Python is used in the industry of current time, particularly in the field of communication. And this was a perfect chance for me to improve my Python coding skills to the next level. 
During this internship I was given with the project of validating the ipv4 addresses, converting them to many forms and transferring them to a file.
